          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><u>In my last post</u></b>, I mentioned an accident in high school. I was injured walking to school one morning and it caused somewhat of a ripple effect. Things began to
             fall apart, classes were harder to catch up in as I wasn't in school, my mental state was depleting. I couldn't see the positive at the time, but as I look back, now I see this prepared me
             to learn on my own, teach myself. This skill began to shine in college when some professors' teaching methods didn't resonate with me as well as others, and I had to teach myself in order to
             succeed. My original plan for college was to start at a community college and transfer into a university, saving money. One of the first computer science courses I took was Pascal... in 2013?
             Even the professor had no idea why it was part of the required curriculum. That probably should've been a sign, but what did I know.
             <br> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             After spending money on classes that didn't seem necessary, the school changed what was required for a computer programming degree. In fact, they removed that degree and created all new paths
             with all new requirements. This felt shady, but I understood they were behind on the changes of that industry. I decided I needed practical knowledge to pair with the theories that college
             teaches. So, I began utilizing my ability to teach myself through videos, articles, and practices. There were many afternoons spent with the counselors to plan my courses, which ones I needed,
             which would transfer, where I could transfer. Once I graduated, I was ready to shop for a University (one with a modern Computer Science program).
             In the end, it all comes down to money and I wasn't able to afford a University on my own, and ended up not being able to attend. What now? How am I supposed to get a career without it?
            I believe this is where my ability to teach myself and learn quickly will truly help.
