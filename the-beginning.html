        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computers and technology have been a substantial part of my life ever since I was a kid. There are many memories of building PC's with my dad and thinking a motherboard was so
        expensive because it was $100. I have always been fascinated with how things worked and gaming amplified that, wondering how everything was created by telling a computer what to do.
        My 8th grade math class is when everything really shifted, as a computer science teacher from the high school came to talk to the honors students about computer programming. I remember
        the exact moment when I shot a look at my friend as he said "Ever wonder how video games or websites were made?". Yes?... Yes I do wonder. That was it for me, I was hooked. Around then
        was the time everyone began asking what you wanted to do when you grew up and since 8th grade, my answer stayed relatively the same. Computer Programmer. Obviously, as I understood more,
        the term "Computer Programmer" is a fairly broad one. Although, I feel like the obscurity of it meant I didn't have to explain myself every couple minutes to another family member. This passion
        continued outside math class and into the career ed classes I had, researching the average salaries at the time and how needed the industry was. There was nothing changing my mind, this is what
        I was going to do.
        <br> <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I got into high school, I began my Intro to Web Development courses. I learned about floats and the basic structure of front-end web development, lists, the usual. Creating multi-page sites about
        bears, if I remember correctly. When I saw what I wrote appear in the browser, I felt like an artist (or a magician in the eyes of my less technical family members). Outside of class, I began adding
        mods in Minecraft as I felt more comfortable traversing files and reading code. Things began to slow down after freshman year of high school as I ran out of courses to take, as well as an accident that
        took me out of school for months. No matter what, my passion for programming and web development stays strong. I am excited to land a web developer position and make 13 year old me proud.
